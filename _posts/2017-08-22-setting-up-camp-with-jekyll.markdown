So here's the thing: it's easier, much easier, to think about doing something rather than _actually_ doing something. It will always be infinitely cheaper and safer to do nothing. Nothing can't be critiqued. Nothing can't challenge you. Nothing can't fail.

People have written books about this (probably, I haven't read them) and I bet some pretty passionate blog posts and maybe like a motivational poster too.

This blog exists because I've caught myself believing that having ideas is an accomplishment, when it's really an opportunity that needs some inspection and (if it passes) some buy-in.

[Creativity is a habit](http://a.co/fMUJYmc) (I haven't finished that book either but it's probably good) and at least if I get this down I will have one good habit.

You're done thinking about it. Call it in the air. Don't let your dreams be dreams.
