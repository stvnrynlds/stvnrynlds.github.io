For a while, I've stood on the shore watching a swift river of Javascript frameworks rush by. It's time to jump in.

But first, some liquid courage. Jekyll, don't fail me now.

That's the stuff. Let's do this.

## Topics to Cover

This is going to be a _development_ blog. That means I'm going to need some good code highlighting.

- github pages
- jekyll
- karla google fonts
- thoughtbot style
- syntax highlighter theme: https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/
- Integrating into existing blog


{% highlight scss %}
.sample-code { /* ... */ }
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks!
