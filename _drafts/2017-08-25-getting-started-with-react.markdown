Over the next 6 months (and probably more) I'm going to be writing about the process of creating a for-reals no-lie bona-fide React app that just might fill a real need. I'll be documenting the steps I take here so you can follow along or laugh at me. Either way, I'll be learning.

While I work on the front end of this app, my buddy [Mark Holmes](http://mark.party/) will spearhead the back end. (Mark has incredibly thorough post on configuring a `Digital Ocean` droplet to run Ghost](http://mark.party/up-and-running-with-ghost/) that you should read. If your interests lean toward APIs and the server-side, follow him.)

That said, let's get real.

## The Setup

Before we start development, we need all our tools handy to begin development. My development is going to be taking place on my 27" iMac (running macOS Sierra at this writing), and everything that follows in these posts will assume you're on a Mac.

### Editor: Sublime Text 3
Every developer needs a text editor, and my weapon of choice is Sublime Text 3. I've worked with Atom, VS Code, Brackets, and they're all great, but I kept missing the familiarity and speed of Sublime.

So first, [download Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), and fire it up. Now let's customize:
0. [Install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st3). This will allow you to add themes, plugins, etc. Just paste the code into Sublime's console.
0.
