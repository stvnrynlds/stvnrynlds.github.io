Wanting to show off your front end dev chops but have absolutely no money? Follow these steps and you'll be up and running with a blog running Jekyll and hosted by GitHub pages, _for free_.

I'm all about removing any barriers to creativity, and this is about as streamlined as you can be.

## Setup

Before we get into development, let's talk tools. You're free to choose whatever you'd like, but for my development environment, I know what I like. That means I'm using:


### Sublime Text 3
- Customization
- Package Manager
- Material Theme
- GitGutter
- SidebarEnhancements
- Emmet
- Jekyll Syntax

### iTerm2
- Quake Style Dropdown
- Sublime Alias

## Jekyll
- Install Ruby
- Install Jekyll (v3.5.2)

## GitHub Pages

## Before

Optionally This is a walkthrough on getting up and running with Jekyll.

My ultimate goal is to learn React thoroughly and get job doing what I love. So, how do I get there from here?
